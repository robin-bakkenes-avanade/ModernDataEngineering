### Create an Azure Data Explorer cluster and database

Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. To use Azure Data Explorer, you first create a cluster, and create one or more databases in that cluster. Then you ingest (load) data into a database so that you can run queries against it. In this quickstart, you create a cluster and a database.
